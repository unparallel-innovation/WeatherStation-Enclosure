# Weather Station Enclosure
This enclosure was developed in the context of building the Unparallel Weather Station which will allows anyone to build their own low-cost weather station, using our custom open-source [PCB](https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/WeatherStation-PCB). This enclosure will protect all the connections and the PCB from weather conditions. <br>
In order to assembly the enclosure, please follow the [online manual](https://unparallel-innovation.github.io/WeatherStation-Documentation/). <br>
The [software](https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/WeatherStation-Software) for the weather station is also open-source and can be used as is, or freely customized to meet your own needs and requirements.

In this repository you will find all the obj and stl files which was  exported from tinkercad.<br>
They are also available the GCODES which was created to be used in a Original Prusa i3 MK3, with a filament Fillamentum ASA with the following tweaks: <br>
- Fan off
- The bed will decrease the temperature slowly after finishing the print.

These files can be printed by yourself, if you have a 3D Printer or use some of this stores which can print that to you:
